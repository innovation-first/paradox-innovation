Here at Thales Services NumÃ©riques (*TSN*), we are rather good at technical stuff : we are after all mainly a band of engineers. It reflects in our culture and ideas. Usually a bunch of technophiles will propose an experimentation on a technology applied to a use-case, with value proposition as an afterthought. This kind of bottom-up approach has its uses, but it has its snags and usually these questions remain:

> *What can we say ?*

There is a real question about the kind of things we are allowed to say inside and outside TSN. Invariably the communication is handled by other parties, and our contributions are checked, reviewed and approved by dedicated people. 

This situation hinders us when we just want to promote our findings or experiences. What engages TSN responsability, where lies ours ? Where can we post content ? Some documentation, perhaps in a FAQ or as a set of examples is needed.

> *Can we share our work with our colleagues ?*

Once our work is done and packaged, we usually have a demonstrator, some slides and a repository with our sources and documentation. What can we share internally ? What are the limits ? Once again some FAQ and perhaps a license file is needed.

> *Can we share it with our clients ?*

The same problem is magnified outside *TSN*. Once again some guidelines and a license file are needed.

> *What now ?*

Once everything is said and done, there is the question of the finality of our work. 
Too often, the goal of an innovation track is to .. generate another innovation track. 
There is work to be done to provide a view of the available and alternative paths.

What do you think ?
