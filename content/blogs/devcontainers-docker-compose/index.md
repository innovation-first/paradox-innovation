Modern development environments are complex. Configuring them consistently across machines is time-consuming and error-prone. The Fred project provides an elegant solution to this with its integration of **Dev Containers** and **Docker Compose**—two powerful tools that streamline development and onboarding.

## What Are Dev Containers and Docker Compose?

- **Dev Containers** are isolated, reproducible environments that developers can use in tools like Visual Studio Code. These containers encapsulate the entire development stack—tools, libraries, configurations—ensuring a consistent experience.
- **Docker Compose** is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to configure services, networks, and volumes with a single YAML file.

Together, they solve a crucial problem: ensuring that developers can spin up a full development environment with a single command, regardless of their local machine setup.

## Why It Matters

Here’s why this setup stands out:

### ✅ 1. Reproducible Environments
Every developer gets the *exact same environment*. The Dockerfile installs specific versions of Node.js, Python, and project dependencies, removing "it works on my machine" issues.

### 🚀 2. Faster Onboarding
New contributors can clone the repo, open it in VS Code, and launch a fully configured dev environment in minutes. All backend services come online automatically via Docker Compose.

### 🧩 3. Modular & Scalable
Services are decoupled. Need to debug OpenSearch? Just restart that container. Want to simulate cloud identity management? Keycloak is ready to go.

### 🔐 4. Real-World Simulation
The inclusion of MinIO and Kubernetes allows developers to build and test features against real-world systems locally.

## The Fred Project Setup

The Fred project includes a rich `.devcontainer` directory with three essential components:

- `devcontainer.json` — The main config that tells VS Code how to start the development container.
- `Dockerfile-devcontainer` — Builds the custom dev container image, bundling both frontend and backend toolchains.
- `docker-compose-devcontainer.yml` — Coordinates service dependencies (like PostgreSQL and OpenSearch) during development.

The core services are defined in a broader `docker-compose.yml` under the `deploy/` folder, which includes:

- **PostgreSQL** for data persistence.
- **Keycloak** for identity and access management.
- **OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards** for analytics and observability.
- **MinIO** for object storage.
- A lightweight **Kubernetes cluster (K3s)** for simulating cloud environments.

## Quick Start in VS Code

Want to test it out? Here's how to get going in just a couple of minutes:

1. **Install prerequisites**:
   - Docker (make sure it's running)
   - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - [Dev Containers extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ThalesGroup/fred.git
   cd fred
   ```

3. **Open the folder in VS Code**:
   - Either from the command line: `code .`
   - Or via File > Open Folder...

4. **Reopen in Container**:
   - VS Code should prompt: *"Reopen in Container?"* — click it.
   - Or open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), then run: `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`.

5. **You're in!**
   - The container builds automatically.
   - All services spin up with `docker-compose`.
   - You’re ready to start coding, testing, and debugging immediately.

## Final Thoughts

The Fred project is a textbook example of how to leverage Dev Containers and Docker Compose to supercharge your development workflow. Whether you're working solo or managing a distributed team, tools like these help maintain consistency, improve productivity, and reduce setup friction.
