## Advancing Biomedical Insights with Explainable AI: Spotlight on DAX-1

In the evolving landscape of biomedical research, explainable AI is carving a new path toward understanding protein structure-function relationships. In our latest contribution—published in *NAR Genomics and Bioinformatics*—we joined forces with partners from CNRS, Inserm, and Université Côte d’Azur to tackle a long-standing challenge: identifying functional hotspots in disease-linked proteins using transparent AI models.

The study focused on **DAX-1**, a protein implicated in rare genetic disorders like X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC). While AI tools like AlphaMissense have proven valuable in predicting mutation pathogenicity, they often lack precision in pinpointing *where* within a protein structure these functional disruptions actually occur.

That’s where our team stepped in.

## A New Metric: The AMX Score

We developed a novel method that distills AlphaMissense outputs through structural models generated by OmegaFold. By training an explainable XGBoost model on structural features of thousands of DAX-1 variants, we introduced a new metric—the **AMX score**—which highlights structurally sensitive regions likely to impact protein function.

Unlike traditional approaches that merely flag sequence-based hotspots, the AMX score identifies **spatially clustered, experimentally relevant structural domains**. In DAX-1, this led to the rediscovery of a known interaction surface with the LRH-1 receptor, validating the AMX approach with both computational and biological evidence.

## Why It Matters

Our approach doesn’t require prior experimental knowledge of protein function. By relying solely on predicted variant structures and AI-derived pathogenicity scores, it opens new doors for:

- **Guiding mutagenesis experiments** in lesser-known proteins  
- **Understanding rare diseases** through better structural interpretation of mutations  
- **Targeting drug development** toward stable and functionally essential domains  

We also demonstrated its **generalizability** by applying the method to the p53 tumor suppressor protein, where the AMX score successfully revealed known functional hotspots.

## Enabling Future Discovery

This work underscores the growing synergy between machine learning, structural bioinformatics, and domain expertise. With modest hardware, researchers can now prioritize functionally critical regions in proteins, even in the absence of experimental structures.

The code, datasets, and an interactive [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/100×2rLfIhmwOvfQbe-es38LxPtFJWOBp?usp=sharing) are openly available, enabling the broader scientific community to explore the AMX approach on their proteins of interest.
