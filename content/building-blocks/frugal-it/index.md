# Frugal IT Software Suite

In today's fast-paced digital landscape, managing cloud native applications is a significant challenge, often leading to expenses far exceeding initial projections. As we move towards a future where environmental sustainability and legislative compliance are paramount, designing frugal and efficient cloud solutions becomes essential.

Frugal IT is an innovative software suite designed to optimize Kubernetes applications, with a roadmap to extend support across all cloud-native architectures. 

Our goal is to empower solution architects and platform administrators with the tools they need to manage costs, optimize resource utilization, and ensure sustainable operations.

## Key Features

Frugal IT proposes three main functions: the **inspector**, the **optimizer** and the **adviser**.

### Inspector : Understand your Costs

The inspector monitors your application in real-time and report finops and greenops indicators: 

* Gain clear visibility into your cloud expenditures with intuitive monitoring dashboards.
* Deploy advanced probes to track and analyze cost drivers in real-time.

### Optimizer : Reduce your Costs

Leverage intelligent algorithms to identify potential areas for cost reduction and efficiency improvements.

Receive actionable recommendations to optimize your Kubernetes clusters and, eventually, your entire cloud-native environment.

### Adviser : Audit Reporting and Architecture Scoring

Generate comprehensive audit reports to evaluate the financial and environmental performance of your architecture.

Obtain a "frugality score" to benchmark and improve your infrastructureâ€™s efficiency and sustainability.

## Value Proposition

Frugal IT is your partner in navigating the complexities of FinOps and GreenOps. By providing deep insights, actionable optimizations, and robust reporting, it helps you build cost-effective, sustainable, and compliant cloud solutions.

## How it works

Frugal-It works using simple but innnovative principles. 

1. Your architecture is first discovered and understood by the frugal It AI-powewered assistant. You immediately benefit from a solid description and understanding of your architecture. This alleviates the need to rely on separate design and implementation 
documents. What Frugal It describes is what has been deployed and run. 
2. Frugal-It lets you provide additional information to describe timportant functional, contextual orthe expected service level agreements expected by the application. 
3. Frugal-It collect real-time monitoring KPIs: costs, energy, carbon consumption estimations, and performance.
4. That global knowledge is finally used to provide you with optimisation recommandation. 

Ultimately Frugal-It helps you leveraging the best of cloud native elasticity, scaling on demand andpossibly up to completely shutting down parts or all your application  to stick to the expected usage. As you can expect, the costs and carbon footprint 
can be dramatically reduced.
