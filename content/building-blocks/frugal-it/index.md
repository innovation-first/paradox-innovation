## Unlock Intelligent Automation and Optimization for Kubernetes Applications

Managing cloud-native applications efficiently is critical for staying competitive. Kubernetes, the backbone of modern application orchestration, presents immense power but also complexity. Businesses struggle to balance performance, cost-efficiency, and sustainability when running large-scale Kubernetes clusters.

Our AI-powered Kubernetes optimization platform is designed to simplify and enhance how enterprises manage their Kubernetes applications. By combining advanced generative AI with human expertise, our platform goes beyond simple monitoring. We offer automated insights, scoring, and actionable recommendations to optimize applications for cost, carbon footprint, and performance.

What sets us apart is our dual focus on sustainability and business optimization. By incorporating external data, such as real-time electricity mix, and capturing business usage patterns from users, we enable smarter, greener decision-making. This approach helps businesses not only reduce costs but also minimize their carbon footprint, all while aligning infrastructure with actual business demands.

</div>

### Inspector : Understand your Costs

The inspector monitors your application in real-time and report finops and greenops indicators: 

* Gain clear visibility into your cloud expenditures with intuitive monitoring dashboards.
* Deploy advanced probes to track and analyze cost drivers in real-time.

### Optimizer : Reduce your Costs

Leverage intelligent algorithms to identify potential areas for cost reduction and efficiency improvements.

Receive actionable recommendations to optimize your Kubernetes clusters and, eventually, your entire cloud-native environment.

### Adviser : Audit Reporting and Architecture Scoring

Generate comprehensive audit reports to evaluate the financial and environmental performance of your architecture.

Obtain a "frugality score" to benchmark and improve your infrastructure’s efficiency and sustainability.
