# Frugal IT Software Suite

In today's fast-paced digital landscape, managing cloud costs effectively is a significant challenge, often leading to expenses far exceeding initial projections. As we move towards a future where environmental sustainability and legislative compliance are paramount, designing frugal and efficient cloud solutions becomes essential.

Frugal IT is an innovative software suite designed to optimize Kubernetes applications initially, with a roadmap to extend support across all cloud-native architectures. 

Our goal is to empower platform administrators with the tools they need to manage costs, optimize resource utilization, and ensure sustainable operations.

## Key Features

Frugal IT proposes three main functions: the **inspector**, the **optimizer** a,d the **adviser**.


### Inspector : Understand your Costs


Gain clear visibility into your cloud expenditures with intuitive monitoring dashboards.

Deploy advanced probes to track and analyze cost drivers in real-time.

### Optimizer : Reduce your Costs

Leverage intelligent algorithms to identify potential areas for cost reduction and efficiency improvements.

Receive actionable recommendations to optimize your Kubernetes clusters and, eventually, your entire cloud-native environment.

### Adviser : Audit Reporting and Architecture Scoring

Generate comprehensive audit reports to evaluate the financial and environmental performance of your architecture.

Obtain a "frugality score" to benchmark and improve your infrastructureâ€™s efficiency and sustainability.

## Value Proposition
