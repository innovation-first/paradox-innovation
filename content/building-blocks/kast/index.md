  ## Thales Development Accelerator for Containerized Projects

  > KAST is an inner source development accelerator designed to streamline the initiation of containerized projects across various domains, including data analytics and defense, even under stringent security constraints. It offers a lightweight, flexible, and comprehensive containerized stack that integrates essential services and open-source data analytics components.

  ## Key Features

  - **Rapid Deployment:** Quickly set up a production-ready Kubernetes cluster tailored to your specific needs.
  - **Integrated Services:** Optionally include services such as logs and metrics management, Identity and Access Management (IAM), storage solutions, data ingestion, data analysis, and stream processing.
  - **Versatile Deployment:** Deploy KAST in diverse environments, whether on-premises, private cloud, or public cloud. It scales from a single laptop to multiple clusters of machines (from 1 to n, based on requirements).

  ## Benefits

  - **Efficiency:** Accelerate the development process with a ready-to-use, fully integrated containerized stack.
  - **Flexibility:** Customize your deployment with additional services as needed.
  - **Scalability:** Adapt to different scales of deployment, from small-scale testing on a single laptop to large-scale production across multiple clusters.
  - **Kast Support:** KAST is supported by a Thales team with a long expertise with K8S ecosystem and a technical support, ensuring reliable and responsive assistance for your projects.
  - **Long Term Support:** Up to *Fl√®che* all LTS versions are supported 18 months and with *Gemini* all LTS versions will be supported 3 years.

  KAST enables users to quickly and efficiently initiate and manage containerized projects, 
  ensuring that they meet security requirements and operational demands.

  Refer to the online Kast documentation for detail. In a nutshell Kast provides three packs: 

  - **Core:** the base components and deployer to deploy a standard K8 stack. 
  - **Data:** a set of additional components and serverless applications to facilitate the design of data centric, streaming or batch applications.
  - **Edge:** a ligthweight instance and deployer to accomadate edge deployments.
