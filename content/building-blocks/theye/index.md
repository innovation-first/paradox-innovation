## The Eye 

The Eye provides real-time help to mobile technicians via augmented reality devices. 

## The disruption challenge

Industrial equipments are designed to be reliable and complete failure is relatively rare. 
But when things do go wrong, delays rapidly escalate.

One of the problems facing industrial or military systems maintenance teams is dealing 
with equipment from different suppliers: tracking down the right information to make repairs is not always easy.

Equipment suppliers also struggle to help. Unless they can completely understand a problem on site, providing reliable advice to maintenance teams can be difficult. Fixing legacy systems can be even harder, with only a handful of experts available to offer help. Getting the right people on site can add hours to delays.

## Knowledge sharing

The Eye is designed to tackle these problems. It works by using augmented reality to provide a two-way link between maintenance staff in the field and expert back office advisors. Valuable knowhow is shared, shrinking repair times and improving the quality of maintenance.

“The maintainer wears augmented reality glasses which automatically stream live video and audio to the back office” explains Dr Amine Arezki, Product Line Manager, Thales. “The advisor in the back office can see exactly what’s happening in the field on a PC screen. They can then positively identify the equipment involved and provide advice about any maintenance or repair work that may be needed.”

As well as being able to see the equipment in the field via video link, the expert can ‘show’ the maintainer precisely which components need attention and what action is required.

The advisor can highlight components using virtual ‘objects’ which are directly superimposed over the maintainer’s real-world view as seen through the glasses.

“The advisor can highlight components using virtual ‘objects’ which are directly superimposed over the maintainer’s real-world view as seen through the glasses,” says Arezki. “For example, the advisor could select a virtual screwdriver and then point it to exactly where it’s needed.” 

Images, drawings and written instructions can also be shared with maintainers via the glasses. Two-way audio communication is also provided.


As well as providing a link to the infrastructure owner’s in-house experts, ThEye could be used to connect maintenance staff directly with equipment suppliers.

The approach can be used with any type of field equipment. This includes everything from signalling apparatus – such as point machines, axle counters, signals and interlockings – to power supply systems and on board equipment on trains. Both current and legacy systems can be supported using ThEye.

## Troubleshooting in real time

Live troubleshooting not only means faster fault identification, but also quicker repairs. “In addition, there is the assurance that an expert is there to oversee the job from start to finish,” says Arezki.

Better support boosts the confidence of maintenance workers. 

“Normally, if a maintainer is having a problem on site and can’t solve it, work has to stop until the supplier is contacted or extra help is called in,” notes Arezki. “This inevitably causes disruption. With ThEye, expert advice is easily available and traffic delays are minimised.”


With ThEye, expert advice is easily available and traffic delays are minimised.
The solution improves productivity. Because key information is delivered via glasses, there’s no need for the maintainer to handle a tablet or smart phone, leaving both hands free to get on with the job.

ThEye also helps on site operators to make the most of valuable skills. Centralising the most experienced staff means experts are able to share their knowhow widely and easily – without the time penalty of travelling to and from work sites. Remote supervision also increases the efficiency and assurance of maintainer training and refresher programmes.

The solution meets other needs as well. There’s no language barrier, thanks to visual communication using icons that are universally understood. The ability to use visual cues – rather than spoken instructions – is also important in the trackside environment, where ambient noise levels can be high.

ThEye could help operators to get the most out of investments in predictive maintenance, with faster interventions leading to reductions in mean time to repair (MTTR).

## Safety in mind

As with all Thales’ solutions, safety and security are key considerations. Unlike virtual reality headsets (which cover the entire field of vision), augmented reality glasses do not obscure the user’s overall view of the surrounding environment. Normal vision is maintained.

The aim is to minimise visual distraction, only the relevant information is shared.

By improving the efficiency of maintenance operations, ThEye could contribute to overall workforce safety by reducing the amount of time maintenance teams need to spend in the hazardous trackside environment.

Despite its game-changing potential, ThEye is remarkably intuitive and easy to use, with no special training required. “You just put on the glasses and get to work,” says Arezki.
