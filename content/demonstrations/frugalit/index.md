## Frugal IT Live Preview

This [Frugal IT](/building-blocks/frugal-it) demonstration is work in progress. 
We start it on demand, please get in touch with the contacts below. 

## What you see

This is a fairly complete demonstration of the Frugal IT suite. There are several 
sample applications, one of them an AWS EKS log management application, the Hub itself, and an on-premise
Kast application. All are monitored using Frufal IT.

The Frugal IT itself runs as part of the innovation Hub platform in SaaS mode, 
that is on GCP/GKE.
