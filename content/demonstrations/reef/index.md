The [Reef project](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/group/responsability/magazine/thales-contest-sparks-new-ways-make-technology-more-frugal), 
winner of the 2023 Frugal By Design Thales contest, resulted in delivering inner source components to design smart serverless architectures
using Rust and WebAssembly. Here is a quick video to understand the potential of such component when deployed on top of a serverless platform, in this case the [punch](https://punchplatform.com).
