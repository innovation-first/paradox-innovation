## Getting Started

It all starts the [Thales Digital Gitlab repository](https://gitlab.thalesdigital.io). This is where we assume you developped one or several applications. 

For the sake of clarity, we will explain how you can deploy a sample [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) application, a popular python framework do deploy simple but effective data or gen AI prototypes. A [sample streamlit application](https://gitlab.thalesdigital.io/tsn/innovation/projects/streamlit) is available for you to start from a working example. 

## The big picture

The Hub is, in fact, a managed [Kast](https://kast-portal.dpsc-thales.fr/) platform. Taht is to say, a managed Kubernetes cluster that provides ready to use security and database services. 

To deploy an application, you first need to get in touch with the Hub admin team that will provide you with two starting point: 

1. a dedicated Kubernetes namespace. This is where you will deploy your application
2. Sample CI/CD, helm charts and documentations for you to generate docker images, and deploy them automatically to the Hub.
