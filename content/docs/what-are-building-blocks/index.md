## Overview

You will find on the hub some posts tagged as 'building blocks'. What are these ? What can you expect from them ?
This short documentation clarifies these questions. 

First remember that Thales Services Num√©riques does not build software products. But we do, of course, maintain a clear technical strategy and policy. It may thus be relevant for us to develop, maintain or capitalize on 
some (so-called) building blocks that provide us with a competitive advantage to bootstrapcustomer projects. 

## Building Block Types

### Software Components

A building block is most often a software or set of software compinents that are maintained, documented, possibly 
even associated with a licensing strategy or in contrary be an inner or open source software. 
Such building blocks look like familiar software products. They are not. Only our customers (intra or extra group) build
products. 
 
It may also happen however that we implement and support building blocks on demand for Thales group units. Kast is the typical example. It is very close to be a product, it has a product owner, a reviewed roadmap, and a licensing strategy. 

### Enablers

The word *enabler* (or *accelelerator*) best describes components that may not be associated with a 
long lifetime, or even be supported at all, but that provide an effective and valuable 
starting point for building new projects. Most building blocks are, in fact, enablers. 

A typical example are generative AI frameworks. SHould a project start form scratch, it would require
lots of effort to put in place the architecture, the various components (most often open source), review their security
and maturity levels, etc..

Hence our effort to identify fairly complete and mastered assemblyset of components, ensuring the architecture, 
and each component is well understood and mastered. 

Why only enablers then ? Simply because it would be counter-productive and at the end a penalty to maintain components that may become obsolete after only a few months.  

### Practices and methodologies

Last, some building block may be associated with our expertise more than in specific software assets. 
Examples are: 

* Our internal best practice security, architecture, greenops rulesets.
* Well dentified referential
* Tools and practices associated to specific consulting offerings  

## What you will find on the Hub

The hub only provide very general information about the building blocks. FOr each, refer to the contact to get the
details such as maturity levels, licensing, terms of use, etc..
