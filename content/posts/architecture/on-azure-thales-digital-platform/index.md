## Security Matters
The Hub runs on any cloud or on your laptop. 
This said we need robust and secured environments to explore innovative
use cases with customers, in particular to deal with sensitive datasets.

## The best of Thales Group
Thales Digital Platform on Azure provides a secure and scalable managed kubernetes.
Not only the data is protected, the TDP offers many essential data services
such as storage, queues, or ML studio.

## The Hub on TDP
On top of it we deploy only the lightweight Punch layer to benefit from
the simple and straightforward configuration and deployment management.

## Vendor Locking ?
The TDP is powered by Azure. This said once your MVP is achieved,
moving to an on on-premise environment is possible using 
Thales Kubernetes analytics stack. It all depends on what you use
from Azure.
