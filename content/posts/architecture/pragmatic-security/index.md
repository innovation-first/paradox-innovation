## Keep It Simple Sir
The Hub adopts a uniquely pragmatic approach to security, centered around a single-domain 
strategy that eschews the complexity of OAuth protocols. Instead, we employ single-site domain 
cookies, a method that not only simplifies user authentication but also seamlessly integrates 
with our robust security framework.

## Zero trust is not complex
Our zero-trust architecture is underpinned by a combination of static and context-aware 
security policies, offering a dynamic defense mechanism that adapts to evolving threats. 
This blend of simplicity and innovation allows us to meet and exceed the most stringent security 
requirements, embodying what we refer to as 'pragmatic security.'

This security design, developed in collaboration with the cybersecurity experts at Thales Services 
Num√©riques, is both straightforward and groundbreaking. It exemplifies our commitment to providing 
a secure, user-friendly platform that doesn't compromise on protection or performance. 
Through this approach, The Hub sets a new standard for security in the digital age, 
ensuring that simplicity and innovation go hand in hand.
