## Stay focus on applications, not platforms
The Hub redefines Kubernetes-native application development by focusing squarely on applications, 
not the underlying complexity of services like databases or security services. 
With preinstalled services at your disposal, 
we've simplified the development process to its core essentials.

All you need is an application image. A dedicated Kubernetes operator takes care of managing your app, 
streamlining deployment and operations. To deploy, simply define your application configuration within 
a straightforward YAML Custom Resource Definition (CRD) file. Once your CRD is prepared, 
push it to your git repository, or push it directly to the Hub and you're set. 
That's it—no dealing with secrets, bypassing the hassle of Helm charts, and avoiding complex templating systems

## Where comes the magic ?
Because at Thales Services Numériques we deliver on-premise data platforms
for critical and secured applications. Simplifying the costs of ownership, maintainance
and operations is of paramount importance. Tha is why we designed kubernetes operators, artifactory
servers, low-code serverless engines. You see them in action for the Hub website itself. Think
of what you can do for you own apps.
