      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="go-experiment">Go experiment</h2>
<p>With The Hub, designing smart data applications becomes astonishingly straightforward and rapid.
In just a few hours, you can move from concept to creation, thanks to our streamlined deployment
process that eliminates traditional complexities.</p>
<h2 id="you-have-containers--ready-to-go">You have containers ? Ready to go</h2>
<p>Deploying standard containerized applications is simplicity itself. Forget the
convolutions of Helm charts and the intricacies of DevOps workflows. All it takes is designing
your application, adding a descriptor file to GitLab, and crafting an intuitive user interface.</p>
<h2 id="think-forward">Think forward</h2>
<p>This approach not only accelerates the development cycle but also democratizes application design,
enabling you to focus on innovation and user experience without being bogged down by backend logistics.
The Hub is your gateway to deploying smart data applications with ease, speed, and reliability,
transforming the way applications are developed and launched.</p>

<p>Thales Digital Platform on Azure provides a secure and scalable managed kubernetes.
Not only the data is protected, the TDP offers many essential data services
such as storage, queues, or ML studio.</p>
<h2 id="the-hub-on-tdp">The Hub on TDP</h2>
<p>On top of it we deploy only the lightweight Punch layer to benefit from
the simple and straightforward configuration and deployment management.</p>
<h2 id="vendor-locking-">Vendor Locking ?</h2>
<p>The TDP is powered by Azure. This said once your MVP is achieved,
moving to an on on-premise environment is possible using
Thales Kubernetes analytics stack. It all depends on what you use
from Azure.</p>
