With preinstalled services at your disposal, we\u0026rsquo;ve simplified the development process to its core essentials.\nAll you need is an application image. A dedicated Kubernetes operator takes care of managing your app, streamlining deployment and operations. To deploy, simply define your application configuration within a straightforward YAML Custom Resource Definition (CRD) file. Once your CRD is prepared, push it to your git repository, or push it directly to the Hub and you\u0026rsquo;re set. That\u0026rsquo;s it—no dealing with secrets, bypassing the hassle of Helm charts, and avoiding complex templating systems\nWhere comes the magic ? Because at Thales Services Numériques we deliver on-premise data platforms for critical and secured applications. Simplifying the costs of ownership, maintainance and operations is of paramount importance. Tha is why we designed kubernetes operators, artifactory servers, low-code serverless engines. You see them in action for the Hub website itself.
