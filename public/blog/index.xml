      <description>The journey to data valorisation.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="go-experiment">Go experiment</h2>
<p>With The Hub, designing smart data applications becomes astonishingly straightforward and rapid.
In just a few hours, you can move from concept to creation, thanks to our streamlined deployment
process that eliminates traditional complexities.</p>
<h2 id="you-have-containers--ready-to-go">You have containers ? Ready to go</h2>
<p>Deploying standard containerized applications is simplicity itself. Forget the
convolutions of Helm charts and the intricacies of DevOps workflows. All it takes is designing
your application, adding a descriptor file to GitLab, and crafting an intuitive user interface.</p>
<h2 id="think-forward">Think forward</h2>
<p>This approach not only accelerates the development cycle but also democratizes application design,
enabling you to focus on innovation and user experience without being bogged down by backend logistics.
The Hub is your gateway to deploying smart data applications with ease, speed, and reliability,
transforming the way applications are developed and launched.</p>

Not only the data is protected, the TDP offers many essential data services
such as storage, queues, or ML studio.</p>
<h2 id="the-hub-on-tdp">The Hub on TDP</h2>
<p>On top of it we deploy only the lightweight Punch layer to benefit from
the simple and straightforward configuration and deployment management.</p>
<h2 id="vendor-locking-">Vendor Locking ?</h2>
<p>The TDP is powered by Azure. This said once your MVP is achieved,
moving to an on on-premise environment is possible using
Thales Kubernetes analytics stack. It all depends on what you use
from Azure.</p>

      <description>A simple and innovative zero trust security architecture.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="keep-it-simple-sir">Keep It Simple Sir</h2>
<p>The Hub adopts a uniquely pragmatic approach to security, centered around a single-domain
strategy that eschews the complexity of OAuth protocols. Instead, we employ single-site domain
cookies, a method that not only simplifies user authentication but also seamlessly integrates
with our robust security framework.</p>
<h2 id="zero-trust-is-not-complex">Zero trust is not complex</h2>
<p>Our zero-trust architecture is underpinned by a combination of static and context-aware
security policies, offering a dynamic defense mechanism that adapts to evolving threats.
This blend of simplicity and innovation allows us to meet and exceed the most stringent security
requirements, embodying what we refer to as &lsquo;pragmatic security.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This security design, developed in collaboration with the cybersecurity experts at Thales Services
Num√©riques, is both straightforward and groundbreaking. It exemplifies our commitment to providing
a secure, user-friendly platform that doesn&rsquo;t compromise on protection or performance.
Through this approach, The Hub sets a new standard for security in the digital age,
ensuring that simplicity and innovation go hand in hand.</p>

      <title>Simple to understand, simple to use</title>
      <link>https://example.org/posts/architecture/simple-to-understand-simple-to-use/</link>

      <guid>https://example.org/posts/architecture/simple-to-understand-simple-to-use/</guid>
      <description>Here is how it works.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 id="stay-focus-on-applications-not-platforms">Stay focus on applications, not platforms</h2>
<p>The Hub redefines Kubernetes-native application development by focusing squarely on applications,
not the underlying complexity of services like databases or security services.
With preinstalled services at your disposal,
we&rsquo;ve simplified the development process to its core essentials.</p>
<p>All you need is an application image. A dedicated Kubernetes operator takes care of managing your app,
streamlining deployment and operations. To deploy, simply define your application configuration within
a straightforward YAML Custom Resource Definition (CRD) file. Once your CRD is prepared,
push it to your git repository, or push it directly to the Hub and you&rsquo;re set.
That&rsquo;s it‚Äîno dealing with secrets, bypassing the hassle of Helm charts, and avoiding complex templating systems</p>
<h2 id="where-comes-the-magic-">Where comes the magic ?</h2>
<p>Because at Thales Services Num√©riques we deliver on-premise data platforms
for critical and secured applications. Simplifying the costs of ownership, maintainance
and operations is of paramount importance. Tha is why we designed kubernetes operators, artifactory
servers, low-code serverless engines. You see them in action for the Hub website itself. Think
of what you can do for you own apps.</p>
