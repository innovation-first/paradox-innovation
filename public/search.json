With preinstalled services at your disposal, we’ve simplified the development process to its core essentials.\nAll you need is an application image. A dedicated Kubernetes operator takes care of managing your app, streamlining deployment and operations. To deploy, simply define your application configuration within a straightforward YAML Custom Resource Definition (CRD) file. Once your CRD is prepared, push it to your git repository, or push it directly to the Hub and you’re set. That’s it—no dealing with secrets, bypassing the hassle of Helm charts, and avoiding complex templating systems\nWhere comes the magic ? Because at Thales Services Numériques we deliver on-premise data platforms for critical and secured applications. Simplifying the costs of ownership, maintainance and operations is of paramount importance. Tha is why we designed kubernetes operators, artifactory servers, low-code serverless engines.
